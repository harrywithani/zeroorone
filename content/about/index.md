**hello, friend.**  
I like taking systems apart — understanding how they work under the hood, and then rebuilding them better. I'm driven by curiosity, not checklists.

With a background in physics and data science, I gravitate toward things that require real thinking: Linux, networking, DevOps, and low-level tooling. I'm most comfortable in the terminal, whether I’m scripting automation, analyzing packet flows, or spinning up containers.

Right now, I’m exploring infrastructure deeply — and I plan to go even lower, into kernel development and system security.
