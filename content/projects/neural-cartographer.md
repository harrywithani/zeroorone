# Neural Cartographer

An AI-powered tool that automatically generates interactive concept maps from my personal note-taking corpus. By analyzing semantic relationships between ideas, topics, and concepts, it creates dynamic visualizations that help me explore connections I might have missed.

## Overview

The Neural Cartographer emerged from my frustration with losing track of related ideas scattered across hundreds of notes. Instead of manually creating mind maps, I wanted a system that could automatically discover and visualize the conceptual landscape of my thoughts.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Analysis** - Uses NLP to identify relationships between concepts
- **Interactive Exploration** - Click and drag to explore the concept graph
- **Auto-updating** - Refreshes connections as new notes are added
- **Export Options** - Save maps as SVG, PNG, or interactive HTML
- **Search Integration** - Find notes through the visual interface

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The system consists of three main components:
1. **Text Processor** - Extracts and normalizes content from markdown notes
2. **Relationship Engine** - Builds semantic graphs using sentence transformers
3. **Visualization Layer** - Renders interactive graphs with D3.js

### Key Technologies
- **Python** - Core processing and API
- **spaCy & Transformers** - Natural language processing
- **NetworkX** - Graph data structures and algorithms
- **D3.js** - Interactive visualizations
- **FastAPI** - Web API for real-time updates

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-cartographer
cd neural-cartographer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the processor on your notes
python process_notes.py --input ./notes --output ./graph_data

# Start the web interface
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to explore your concept maps.

## What I Learned

This project taught me a lot about:
- **NLP Pipeline Design** - Balancing accuracy with performance
- **Graph Algorithms** - Community detection and layout optimization  
- **Interactive Visualization** - Making complex data explorable
- **Personal Knowledge Management** - How we actually think about and connect ideas

## Future Improvements

Integration with popular note-taking apps (Obsidian, Notion)
Collaborative features for shared knowledge bases
Mobile-responsive interface
Real-time collaboration on concept maps
Export to various graph formats
